## POST 1: r/PersonalFinanceCanada

**Title:**
> Built a free tool that tells you which credit card to use at each store in Canada (410+ cards from all major banks)

**Body:**
Hey PFC,

I've been frustrated for years watching my rewards stack go to waste because I couldn't remember which card earns what where. My partner kept defaulting to her Visa everywhere instead of switching to Amex at grocery stores — we were probably leaving $400–500/year on the table without realizing it.

So I built **Rewardly** — a free app that lets you search any store and instantly see which card in your wallet earns the most, including loyalty program stacking (e.g., it knows to use PC Optimum + your PC World Elite at Shoppers, or Scene+ + your Scotia Passport at Sobeys).

**What it does:**
- 410+ Canadian cards from TD, RBC, BMO, CIBC, Scotiabank, Amex
- Real earn rates by category (groceries, dining, gas, travel, etc.)
- Loyalty program layering — Aeroplan, PC Optimum, Scene+, Air Miles
- Wallet optimizer — shows gaps in your card portfolio
- Signup ROI calculator — is the welcome bonus worth it given the annual fee?
- Fee breakeven analysis — should you keep renewing?
- Sage AI — ask anything about Canadian credit card strategy

It's free to use. Privacy-first — no bank account linking, no shared data.

Web app: rewardly.ca (mobile app also available)

Genuinely curious what the PFC community thinks. Happy to answer any questions about how the earn rates are sourced or how the recommendations work.

Disclosure: I built this. Not affiliated with any of the banks.

## POST 2: r/churningcanada

**Title:**
> Made a free Canadian card optimizer — 410+ cards, tracks earn rates by store, Aeroplan/PC Optimum/Scene+ stacking

**Body:**
Hey churners,

Long-time lurker, built something I think this community would actually find useful.

**Rewardly** — a free tool specifically for the Canadian market. Core use case: you type in a merchant (Costco, Shoppers, Uber Eats, Shell, whatever) and it shows your optimal card + loyalty program combo from your wallet.

Relevant for this sub:
- Full Aeroplan earn rate data across all Aeroplan-earning cards (and which card earns more per dollar at which merchant)
- Signup ROI calculator — if you're evaluating a welcome bonus, plug in the spend requirement and it shows you the breakeven against the annual fee
- 5/24 tracker for anyone doing cross-border churning
- Fee breakeven analysis for annual cards

The database has 410+ Canadian cards — all the big issuers. Earn rates are actively maintained (not a static spreadsheet).

Not trying to spam — this sub is full of people who actually optimize their cards and I think it's genuinely relevant. Happy to answer questions about how it works or take feature requests.

Link: rewardly.ca
App also available on iOS/Android.

Disclosure: I'm the developer.

## Notes on Tone
- Both posts lead with the **problem/value** before the product
- Disclosure is explicit in both
- No aggressive CTAs — just "here's what it does"
- r/churningcanada post uses churning-specific language (ROI calculator, 5/24, breakeven)
- r/PersonalFinanceCanada post targets the broader audience (loyalty stacking, wallet optimization)

## Screenshots to Attach
Before posting, grab screenshots of:
1. Store search result (e.g., "Shoppers Drug Mart" showing PC Optimum + card recommendation)
2. Wallet optimizer view
3. Signup ROI calculator in action

## Timing Recommendation
- Post r/PersonalFinanceCanada between **10am–12pm ET on a weekday** (highest engagement)
- Post r/churningcanada same day, 2–3 hours later
- Stay online for first 2 hours to respond to comments
