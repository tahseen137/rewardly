# Maximize Your Cashback: A Canadian's Guide to Credit Card Stacking in 2026

Most Canadians are leaving $800 to $1,400 a year on the table. That's not an estimate — that's what I see when I run the numbers for an average household through [Rewardly's card comparison tool](https://rewardly.ca). The problem isn't that people don't care. It's that nobody told them about stacking.

## What Card Stacking Actually Is (And Why Your Bank Won't Tell You)

Card stacking is using multiple credit cards strategically — each one optimized for a specific spending category — so you're always earning the highest rate possible on every dollar. You put groceries on Card A, gas on Card B, travel bookings on Card C. You pay all of them in full every month. Done.

Banks don't advertise this because their ideal customer is someone who puts everything on one card and calls it a day. Preferably a card with a $120 annual fee and a 1.5% flat cashback rate. That's good for them. Not for you.

The math changes completely when you stack. A flat 1.5% card on $4,500/month in spending earns you about $810 a year. That same spending across three optimized cards? $1,600 to $2,200. Same purchases. Just different plastic.

## Before You Start: The Baseline Rules

A few things that matter before we get into specific combos.

**Pay every bill in full.** This sounds obvious but it's not optional. Interest at 19.99–22.99% APR destroys every reward you earn and then some. If carrying a balance is your situation right now, stacking isn't for you yet. Fix that first.

**Track your actual spending.** Not what you think you spend. Pull three months of bank statements. Canadians dramatically underestimate grocery and dining spend in particular. Most households I've seen are spending $900–$1,200/month on groceries alone, which changes which card makes sense as your anchor.

**Don't apply for too many cards at once.** Each hard pull hits your credit score. Space applications at least 90 days apart. Apply for two cards that work well together, use them for 6 months, then add a third if it makes sense.

**Watch annual fees against actual value.** A card with a $150 annual fee that earns you $700 in rewards is worth it. The same card if you only spend $200 in its bonus categories isn't. This is where most people get tripped up — they get excited about a premium card that only pays off at high spending levels they don't hit.

## The 5 Best Stacking Combos in Canada Right Now

### Combo 1: The Everyday Workhorse (Best for Most Canadians)

**American Express Cobalt + CIBC Dividend Visa Infinite**

This is the combo I'd recommend to 80% of Canadian households. It covers the two biggest spend categories — groceries and everything else — with minimal complexity.

**Amex Cobalt** earns 5x Membership Rewards points on restaurants and eligible grocery stores (including Sobeys, Metro, FreshCo, and most independents). That's effectively 5% back when you redeem points for travel or statement credits via the optimal transfer partners. Annual fee: $155.88 ($12.99/month charged monthly, which is actually helpful for people who want to test it before committing).

**CIBC Dividend Visa Infinite** earns 4% cashback on gas and grocery (yes, it stacks grocery spend as real cashback, not points). Also 2% on Tim Hortons, transit, and recurring bills. For everything else: 1%. Annual fee: $120, but the first year is free through most CIBC branches right now. Real cashback. No conversion math needed.

**How you'd split it:** Cobalt goes on all restaurants and Amex-accepting grocery stores. CIBC goes on gas, transit, and Costco (Amex isn't accepted there — one of those rare frustrations you'll run into). Everything else? Put it on CIBC for the flat 1%.

**Estimated annual value** on a household spending $1,100/month groceries, $250/month restaurants, $180/month gas, $200/month transit/recurring bills, $800/month everything else:
- Cobalt on groceries + restaurants: ~$820
- CIBC on gas + transit + everything else: ~$430
- Total earned: **~$1,250/year**
- Annual fees: $276
- **Net: ~$974**

Compare that to $1,340 earned on a flat 2% card with zero annual fee... except there's no 2% flat cashback card in Canada (not a great one anyway). The best flat-rate cards top out around 1.5–1.75%. So $974 net from Cobalt + CIBC beats a hypothetical flat-rate at 1.5% which would give you $585.

### Combo 2: The Travel Maximizer (For Frequent Flyers Who Like Aeroplan)

**TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite + American Express Aeroplan**

If you fly Air Canada more than twice a year, this combo is almost unfair.

The **TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite** earns 1.5 Aeroplan points per dollar on gas, grocery, and Air Canada purchases, and 1 point on everything else. Valuable perks: free checked bag (worth $35 each way, $140 for a couple on a return), priority boarding, and $100 annual TD travel credit. Annual fee: $139, effectively close to free after the bag benefit if you check luggage.

The **Amex Aeroplan** earns 1 point per dollar on everything (and a 10% anniversary bonus on your first year). But it's the earn structure on dining, delivery, and gas that's interesting — 2x at eligible restaurants and Amex Travel. Plus: global lounge access at Centurion, Priority Pass, and Delta Sky Club. The annual fee is $599, which is brutal, but the lounge access alone is worth $500+ if you travel monthly.

For most people, the TD card alone is the better play. But if you're flying 8–10 times per year, adding the Amex Aeroplan and paying the fee is actually fine math.

**One thing Aeroplan beginners miss:** Aeroplan points are worth dramatically more on long-haul business class than on short-haul economy. A Toronto–London business class seat that would cost $4,500+ in cash can go for 55,000–60,000 points. That's 7–8 cents per point. When you factor that into your earn rate, the effective cashback equivalent on this combo jumps significantly.

Use [Rewardly](https://rewardly.ca) to model your specific spend and it'll tell you exactly what your Aeroplan points are worth given your typical redemption patterns.

### Combo 3: The Grocery + Gas Dominator (No Annual Fee Option)

**PC World Elite Mastercard + MBNA Rewards World Elite Mastercard**

This one is for people who refuse to pay annual fees. Valid choice. You give up some ceiling but you keep more of what you earn.

**PC World Elite Mastercard** earns 45 PC Optimum points per dollar at Loblaw banner stores (Superstore, No Frills, Loblaws, Shoppers Drug Mart) and 30 points per dollar on gas at Esso and Mobil. PC Optimum points convert at 1,000 points = $1, so 45 points = 4.5% back. That's a genuinely ridiculous rate — and this card has zero annual fee. The catch: you need $80,000 household income or $150,000 personal to qualify for the World Elite version. Standard PC Mastercard earns less.

**MBNA Rewards World Elite** earns 5 points per dollar on groceries, restaurants, digital media, memberships, and household utilities. Points cash out at 1 cent each (sometimes better via travel). 5% back on groceries at non-Loblaw stores (i.e., Metro, Sobeys, IGA, FreshCo). Annual fee: $0 in year 1 waived, then... actually just use the PC card at Loblaw and MBNA at non-Loblaw grocery. Keep both. They're free.

**Combined on a typical household:**
- $800/month Loblaw groceries → PC World Elite at 4.5% = $432/year
- $300/month other grocery → MBNA at 5% = $180/year
- $200/month gas (Esso) → PC at 3% = $72/year
- $600/month everything else → 1% = $72/year
- **Total: ~$756/year, $0 in fees**

That's genuinely great for zero cost. You won't match the premium card combos but you won't pay for the privilege either.

### Combo 4: The Dining + Entertainment Stack

**Amex Cobalt + Scotiabank Gold American Express**

Cobalt at 5x on restaurants is already the best earn rate in Canada for dining. But Scotiabank Gold adds something Cobalt doesn't have: No Foreign Transaction Fees, plus 6x Scene+ points at Sobeys, Safeway, IGA, and FreshCo banner stores.

The Scene+ points from Scotiabank Gold redeem at roughly 1 cent each, making 6x = 6% at those grocery banners. That beats Cobalt's 5x at Amex-eligible grocery stores. So your split becomes: Gold at Sobeys/Safeway/IGA banners, Cobalt at Metro/FreshCo and restaurants, CIBC Dividend for gas.

Three cards. Not for everyone. But if you're spending $500+/month dining out and traveling internationally at least once a year (the no-FX fee matters most then), the math works.

**Annual fees:** Cobalt $155.88 + Gold $120 = $275.88 combined. You need to earn over that to justify it. At $500/month dining and $600/month grocery split across both cards, you're well over.

---

### Combo 5: The Business Owner Stack (If You Run a Side Hustle)

**Amex Business Platinum + CIBC Bizline Visa**

Different category entirely but worth mentioning because a lot of Canadians running freelance work, online businesses, or side hustles qualify for business cards — and the earn rates are substantially better.

**Amex Business Platinum** gives 1.25 Membership Rewards per dollar on everything, plus accelerated earn on categories like advertising, shipping, and technology. The real value is the $200 annual travel credit (Air Canada purchases credited back), unlimited Centurion lounge access, and the ability to earn 10x MR on certain rotating bonus categories. Annual fee: $699. Steep. Worth it if you're billing $100K+/year on it.

For smaller businesses: **Amex Business Gold** at $199 annual fee earns 2x on the 2 categories you spend most on (selected each year). That's more accessible.

The business card advantage: you separate business and personal spending clearly, and the MR points stack with whatever personal cards you already have. One redemption pool.

## Real Annual Savings: A Case Study

Meet Priya. She's 34, lives in Scarborough, spends about $5,400/month across all categories. Here's how her spending breaks down (based on her actual statements, not a guess):

- Groceries (Superstore + Sobeys): $1,050/month
- Gas: $190/month
- Restaurants + takeout: $320/month
- Transit (Presto): $156/month
- Online shopping + everything else: $1,100/month
- Recurring bills (phone, streaming, gym): $280/month
- Travel bookings: $300/month (averaged — she takes 2 trips a year)

**Before stacking** (everything on a TD Visa with 1% cashback): $648/year.

**After stacking** (Cobalt for groceries/dining, CIBC Dividend for gas/transit/bills, TD Aeroplan for travel bookings):
- Cobalt: Groceries $700/month at 5x → $420; Dining $320/month at 5x → $192 → combined $612/year in MR at ~1 cent each
- CIBC Dividend: Gas $190/month at 4% → $91.20; Transit + bills $436/month at 2% → $104.64; Remaining on CIBC at 1% → let's say $500/month → $60/year
- TD Aeroplan: Travel $300/month at 1.5x → 5,400 points/year → ~$75 in value

Total earned: **~$942/year**
Annual fees paid: $276 (Cobalt) + $120 waived first year, then $120 (CIBC) → average $218/year
**Net gain over single card:** ~$512/year more than before

Year over year, Priya is pocketing over $500 extra. She didn't change what she buys. She just changed which card she swipes.

## The Things That Trip People Up

**Amex acceptance gaps.** Not every merchant takes Amex. Costco doesn't. Some independent restaurants don't. Some gas stations. Always carry a Visa or Mastercard backup. This is why the Cobalt + CIBC combo works — you've got Amex and Visa covered.

**Points expiry.** Aeroplan points don't expire as long as you have one qualifying activity every 18 months. PC Optimum points don't expire at all. MR points from Amex cards expire if you cancel the card. Know the rules before you close anything.

**Rotating categories.** Some cards change their bonus categories quarterly (BMO Cashback World Elite does this). It adds complexity. Most people find it's not worth tracking — just pick cards with permanent category bonuses.

**The welcome bonus trap.** A lot of cards offer massive first-year bonuses (10,000 to 80,000 points). These are real value and worth chasing. But don't let the bonus cloud your judgment about the card's long-term earn rate. The bonus is a one-time thing. The ongoing rate is forever.

## How to Figure Out Your Optimal Stack

You can do this math manually with a spreadsheet (tedious but possible) or you can use [Rewardly](https://rewardly.ca) to model it. Drop in your spending numbers by category, and it calculates which combination of Canadian cards maximizes your annual return — factoring in annual fees, current welcome bonuses, and your redemption preferences.

It doesn't require signing up. Takes about 3 minutes to get a personalized recommendation.

The tool cross-references 200+ Canadian credit cards, updates rates in real time as banks change their programs, and lets you compare specific combos side by side. I built it because I was frustrated doing this math in a spreadsheet every time a card changed its earn rate (which happens more than you'd think — RBC quietly downgraded their Avion earn structure twice in the last 18 months).

---

## The Short Version

Credit card stacking isn't complicated. You pick 2–3 cards that complement each other, you know which one to pull out in which situation, and you pay them off completely every month. The average Canadian household can realistically earn $700–$1,500 more per year than they currently do on rewards. Not from investing. Not from cutting lattes. From cards they'd be swiping anyway.

The best starting point for most people is Cobalt + CIBC Dividend. If you want zero annual fees, start with PC World Elite + MBNA. If you're a dedicated Aeroplan collector, the TD Visa Infinite is your anchor and you build from there.
