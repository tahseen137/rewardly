# Canadian Travel Hacking 101: How to Fly Business Class for Free in 2026

Most Canadians assume business class is for executives on expense accounts. They're wrong. I've seen regular people — teachers, nurses, freelancers — fly business class to Europe without paying a dollar for the seat. The flight cost them points. The points came from credit cards. The credit cards came from a strategy called travel hacking.

This guide explains exactly how it works in Canada in 2026: which cards to get, which points programs matter, how to actually redeem for a business class seat, and what mistakes to avoid. No fluff. Just the mechanics.

## What Is Travel Hacking Canada?

Travel hacking is the practice of earning large amounts of points and miles through credit card signup bonuses, then redeeming them for flights — usually at a dramatically better value than cash fares would offer.

The math is what makes it work. A business class ticket from Toronto to London retails at $4,000 to $7,000 CAD depending on timing. That same seat on Air Canada might cost 85,000 Aeroplan points in business class (off-peak). At a typical earn rate of 1 point per dollar spent, you'd need to charge $85,000 to your card to earn that. Nobody does that.

But a single credit card welcome bonus? That can be 60,000 to 100,000 points in 2026. One card. One ticket. That's the core of travel hacking.

## The Canadian Points Ecosystem: What Actually Matters

Not all points are equal. Some lock you into one airline. Others convert to multiple programs. Understanding the ecosystem saves you from collecting points you can never spend well.

**Aeroplan** is the most important for Canadians. It's Air Canada's program, but it's also part of the Star Alliance, which means you can use Aeroplan points to book on United, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, Swiss, and 40+ other carriers. This flexibility is what makes Aeroplan the foundation of any Canadian travel hacking strategy.

**Amex Membership Rewards** is the second pillar. Amex points don't directly book flights — they transfer to airline programs. The key transfer partners in Canada are Aeroplan (at 1:1), British Airways Avios (1:1), and Marriott Bonvoy (2:3). The flexibility to park your points in Amex MR before deciding where to transfer is a real advantage.

**Avios** (British Airways, Iberia, Finnair, Air Lingus) deserves attention for specific routes. Avios pricing is distance-based, which makes short-haul premium cabin redemptions extraordinarily cheap. A business class seat from Toronto to Chicago on American Airlines costs as few as 7,500 Avios one-way. Transfer Amex MR points to Avios, book through the BA website on AA metal. Done.

**RBC Avion** points transfer to British Airways Avios and other programs. If you're already banking with RBC, the Avion Visa Infinite is a reasonable on-ramp.

**TD Rewards** are weaker — mostly useful for statement credits against travel purchases rather than premium redemptions. Skip them if your goal is business class.

Everything else — Scotiabank Scene+, CIBC Aventura, BMO Rewards — is in the "fine but not the foundation" category. Useful for vacation economy trips; not the engine of a business class strategy.

## The Cards That Matter in Canada Right Now

### For Aeroplan Points

**TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite**
- Welcome bonus: 50,000 to 75,000 Aeroplan points (watch for elevated offers in Feb/March and September)
- Annual fee: $139
- Earn: 1.5 pts/$ on gas, grocery, and Air Canada; 1 pt/$ everywhere else
- Best for: Aeroplan purists who want a straightforward earn with Air Canada perks

**American Express Aeroplan Reserve**
- Welcome bonus: 85,000 Aeroplan points on elevated offers (standard: 60,000)
- Annual fee: $599
- Earn: 3 pts/$ on Air Canada; 2 pts/$ on dining and food delivery; 1 pt/$ elsewhere
- Best for: Frequent Air Canada flyers who can extract value from the card perks (lounge access, free companion pass, etc.)
- Note: The $599 fee sounds steep. If you're checking one bag on Air Canada twice a year and using the lounge twice, you've already recovered $200+ before the points.

**American Express Cobalt**
- Welcome bonus: 15,000 to 30,000 Amex MR points (paid out monthly over the first year)
- Annual fee: $156 ($13/month)
- Earn: 5 pts/$ on food and drinks (groceries, restaurants, delivery); 3 pts/$ on streaming; 2 pts/$ on travel; 1 pt/$ everywhere else
- Best for: The grocery/restaurant anchor card. The 5x on food spending is unmatched in Canada. If you spend $1,000/month on groceries and dining, that's 60,000 MR points per year from spend alone — before the welcome bonus.

**TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite Privilege**
- Welcome bonus: 85,000 Aeroplan points (elevated periods can hit 100,000)
- Annual fee: $599
- Earn: 2 pts/$ on Air Canada and eligible grocery/gas; 1.5 pts/$ on eligible dining; 1.25 pts/$ everywhere else
- Best for: High spenders who want Aeroplan points and are willing to pay for status-adjacent perks

### For Amex Membership Rewards

**American Express Platinum**
- Welcome bonus: 80,000 to 100,000 Amex MR points
- Annual fee: $799
- Best for: People who can use the credits (hotel credit, airline fee credit, dining credit) to offset the fee. Run the numbers on your actual spending before applying. For many Canadians, the credits bring the effective cost below $400.

**American Express Gold Rewards**
- Welcome bonus: 40,000 to 60,000 Amex MR points
- Annual fee: $250
- Earn: 2 pts/$ on travel and gas; 2 pts/$ on grocery; 1 pt/$ elsewhere
- Best for: A lower-fee Amex MR option. Good second card after the Cobalt.

## A Real Business Class Strategy: Toronto to London

Let's walk through a concrete example. You want to fly business class from Toronto to London. You have no points right now. Here's how to get there in 12 months.

**Month 1-2: Apply for TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite**
- Target a 75,000-point welcome offer (they run periodically — [Rewardly tracks these](https://rewardly.ca) so you don't have to watch manually)
- Meet the spend requirement (usually $5,000–$6,000 in 3 months)
- Points in hand after welcome bonus + spend: ~82,000 Aeroplan

**Month 3-4: Apply for American Express Cobalt**
- Welcome bonus: 30,000 MR (elevated offer)
- Put all grocery and restaurant spending on this card at 5x
- Transfer 30,000 MR to Aeroplan at 1:1 after welcome bonus posts
- Total Aeroplan points: ~112,000

**The Booking**
Air Canada business class (Signature cabin) from Toronto (YYZ) to London (LHR) off-peak: 85,000 Aeroplan points one-way plus ~$250 CAD in taxes and fees.

You've flown business class to London. Your total cash outlay for the flight was $250 CAD. Without this strategy, the same ticket costs $4,500+ CAD.

That's the real math of travel hacking Canada.

## Understanding Aeroplan Redemption Pricing

Aeroplan moved to a dynamic pricing model in 2021, which made some routes more expensive and others cheaper depending on demand. The most useful thing to know in 2026:

**Off-peak pricing (November through January, excluding holidays) saves 15–25%.** Toronto to Frankfurt in business class can drop from 100,000 to 85,000 points in the off-peak window.

**Air Canada "Preferred" seats on partner airlines are often cheaper.** A business class redemption on Lufthansa from Toronto to Munich might be 88,000 points versus 100,000 on Air Canada. Same quality cabin, fewer points.

**"Saver" space vs. "Standard" space matters enormously.** Aeroplan shows both: Saver inventory is allocated by the airline and is limited; Standard costs 20–40% more points but is often available when Saver is not. Always search for Saver space first. If it's not available, wait — it often opens up within 3 weeks of departure as the airline releases unsold seats.

**Stopover and open-jaw bookings** are an underused Aeroplan feature. You can book YYZ-FRA in business class, then FRA-LHR on a separate ticket (cheap European flight), and LHR-YYZ as your return — effectively visiting two destinations on one Aeroplan redemption. This is advanced, but it's genuinely powerful.

## The Signup Bonus is the Game

If there's one thing to internalize about travel hacking, it's this: ongoing earn rates from everyday spending are nice, but the signup bonus is where most of the value comes from.

A $5,000 spend requirement for a 75,000-point bonus effectively earns you 15 points per dollar on that $5,000. Compare that to the 1–2 points per dollar you'd earn on normal spend.

This is why the strategy isn't "pick one card and use it forever." It's "get a card, earn the welcome bonus, use the card for its best category earn, then evaluate whether a new card makes sense in 6–12 months."

The limiting factors are:
1. Your credit score (stay above 700 and you're generally fine for the mainstream travel cards)
2. Amex's one-bonus-per-card-per-lifetime rule (you can only earn a welcome bonus on a given Amex card once, unless there's a specific exception)
3. TD and RBC's 12-month waiting periods (you generally can't earn a welcome bonus if you've held the same card in the past year)

The practical implication: plan your applications. Don't get the TD Aeroplan card during a standard offer when an elevated offer runs every six months. Watch [Rewardly](https://rewardly.ca) for elevated offer alerts before you apply.

## The Mistakes That Kill Travel Hacking Strategies

**Carrying a balance.** Interest at 20%+ wipes out every point you earn and then some. If you can't pay in full monthly, this strategy isn't for you right now.

**Getting excited about the wrong card.** The Scotiabank Gold Amex earns Scene+ points which are useful for flights but redeem at 1 cent per point, capped at cash value. That's fine for an economy trip. For business class hacking, you need Aeroplan or Amex MR.

**Not tracking welcome bonus requirements.** Every card has a minimum spend and a time window. Miss the window, lose the bonus. Set a calendar reminder the day you receive the card. Know the exact amount you need to spend and the date it's due.

**Hoarding points without a redemption plan.** Points devalue over time. Programs change their charts. Currencies get inflated. Have a target trip in mind before you start accumulating. This isn't just motivational advice — it protects you from a points program changing its rates before you can use what you've earned.

**Not checking partner availability.** Aeroplan lets you book on 40+ airlines. Most people only search Air Canada. Open-jaw on Lufthansa, Swiss, or Singapore might be better availability, better product, or cheaper in points. The [Aeroplan search tool](https://www.aeroplan.com) lets you search by partner. Use it.

**Ignoring the stopover.** Aeroplan allows a free stopover on international business class redemptions. Toronto to Singapore might route through Tokyo. Spend a few days in Tokyo for free — no additional points required. This is one of the most underused features in Canadian travel hacking.

## A Practical First-Year Timeline

**January: Research and credit check**
- Pull your credit score (Borrowell and Credit Karma are free in Canada)
- If you're above 700, you're in good shape for all major travel cards

**February: Apply for your first card**
- Target: TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite or Amex Cobalt depending on your spending profile
- High grocery/restaurant spend → Cobalt first
- Occasional but spread-out spending → TD Aeroplan first

**March–May: Meet the spend requirement**
- Use the card for all regular spending
- Never spend extra just to meet the requirement; that defeats the purpose

**June: Apply for your second card**
- If you started with Cobalt, add TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite
- If you started with TD, add Cobalt
- Transfer any Amex MR earned to Aeroplan

**August: Search and book your redemption**
- Aeroplan availability for the following January–March (off-peak) typically opens 10 months in advance
- Business class to Europe often books up fast in Saver space — start searching at the 10-month mark

**January (Year 2): Business class flight**
- Total points used: 85,000 Aeroplan
- Total cash paid: ~$250 CAD in taxes and fees
- Retail cost of the same seat: $4,000–$6,000+ CAD

## How Rewardly Helps

The annoying part of travel hacking Canada isn't the strategy — it's the tracking. Welcome bonus offers change. Elevated periods come and go. Transfer bonuses (where Amex MR temporarily transfers to Aeroplan at 1.25:1 instead of 1:1) appear a few times a year and are worth planning around.

[Rewardly](https://rewardly.ca) tracks all of this automatically. Tell it which cards you hold, and it surfaces the best card for each spending category in real time. It also alerts you when welcome bonus offers hit elevated levels — so you're not applying for the TD Aeroplan at 50,000 points when a 75,000-point offer is 3 weeks away.

For anyone starting a travel hacking strategy, it's the tool that does the work of monitoring so you can focus on actually taking the trips.

## The Bottom Line

Business class travel isn't a luxury reserved for the wealthy. It's a math problem. Welcome bonuses on Canadian travel cards are generous enough that a disciplined person can accumulate enough Aeroplan points for a transatlantic business class seat in under 12 months — without spending a dollar on the flight itself.

The core moves are simple:
1. Find an elevated welcome bonus offer (not just the standard)
2. Apply, meet the spend requirement, earn the bonus
3. Add a high-earn card for your largest spending category (Cobalt for food spend)
4. Search Aeroplan for Saver availability off-peak
5. Book, transfer, done

Travel hacking Canada is one of the few personal finance strategies where the math reliably works in your favor — as long as you pay your balance in full every month and stay disciplined about which cards you hold.

Everything else is just execution.
