# Best Grocery Rewards Cards in Canada 2026

Groceries are the biggest predictable expense in most Canadian households. The average family spends somewhere between $900 and $1,400 a month on food — that's $10,800 to $16,800 a year flowing through checkout lanes and online carts. If you're not earning serious rewards on that spend, you're burning money. Not slowly. Very fast.

The problem with picking a grocery rewards card in Canada is that the right answer depends on where you shop. The card that earns you the most at Sobeys is useless at Costco. The card perfect for No Frills isn't accepted at most independent grocers. So instead of giving you one "best card" and calling it a day, this guide breaks down the five strongest options by their actual mechanics — annual fee, earn rate, redemption value, and real-world restrictions — then runs the numbers on what each card puts back in your pocket over a year.

Let's get into it.

## The 5 Best Grocery Rewards Cards in Canada Right Now

### 1. American Express Cobalt Card
**Best for: Maximum earn rate at most grocery chains**

The Cobalt earns **5 Membership Rewards points per dollar** on groceries and dining in Canada. That's the highest earn rate on groceries you'll find on any general-purpose card. At Sobeys, Metro, FreshCo, IGA, Farm Boy, and most independent grocery stores, nothing comes close.

**Annual fee:** $191.88 ($15.99/month)

The fee went up in November 2025 — a notable 23% jump from the previous $155.88 — which is worth factoring in. It's still worth it for heavy grocery spenders, but the math tightens for lighter spenders.

**Earn rates:**
- 5x on eligible groceries and restaurants in Canada
- 3x on eligible streaming services
- 2x on gas, transit, and travel purchases
- 1x on everything else

**The catch you need to know:** There's a $2,500/month cap on the 5x category (groceries + dining combined). Spending beyond that earns just 1x. For most households this cap isn't a problem — $2,500/month in food is a lot. But if you're frequently hosting, meal prepping for a large household, or running a side business that involves food purchases, track your monthly spend.

**Also:** Amex is not accepted at Loblaws, Costco, or Walmart. If those are your primary grocery stores, the Cobalt will sit in your wallet unused for your biggest category. That's a dealbreaker if you're a dedicated Loblaws or Costco shopper.

**Membership Rewards value:** At face value, 1,000 points = $10 via statement credit. Transfer to Aeroplan or Marriott Bonvoy and you can extract 1.5–2¢ per point for travel, which makes the 5x rate effectively worth 7.5–10% back on groceries when optimized. For cash back purposes, we'll value points at 1¢ each.

**Welcome bonus:** Up to 15,000 Membership Rewards points — earned by spending $750 in each of the first 12 months (so 1,250 points/month bonus on top of regular earn).

### 2. Scotiabank Gold American Express Card
**Best for: Sobeys/Empire shoppers and Scene+ stackers**

The Scotia Gold Amex earns **5 Scene+ points per dollar** at eligible grocery stores in Canada, stepping up to **6x at Empire-affiliated stores** — Sobeys, Safeway, IGA (Quebec), FreshCo, Foodland, Thrifty Foods, and Farm Boy. That 6x rate on groceries is the highest flat earn rate available at any specific grocery chain in the country.

**Annual fee:** $120 (first year frequently rebated via promotional offers)

**Earn rates:**
- 5x on eligible grocery stores, restaurants, food delivery, and entertainment
- 6x at Sobeys/Empire banner stores (stacks on top of the 5x base)
- 3x on gas, transit, and eligible streaming services
- 1x on everything else

**Scene+ points value:** Scene+ points are worth approximately 1¢ each when redeemed for travel bookings through Scene+ Travel, Cineplex tickets, or grocery statement credits. Redemption toward the Scotia Rewards Travel Service gives you the cleanest value — you can also redeem for Sobeys gift cards (1,000 points = $10), which is essentially straight cashback if you shop there regularly.

**The Amex acceptance issue:** Like the Cobalt, this card runs on the Amex network. That means no Costco, no Loblaws/No Frills/Real Canadian Superstore, and no Walmart. If your grocery haul is split between Sobeys and Costco, you'll need a second card to cover the gap.

**The cap:** Unlike the Cobalt, the Scotia Gold Amex has a $50,000 annual spending cap across all 5x/6x categories combined. At $5,000 in grocery spend per month you're hitting the ceiling, but for most families the cap is irrelevant.

**Why it wins for Sobeys shoppers:** The 6x rate at Sobeys is a clear standout. If Sobeys is your primary grocery store, you're earning 6% back in Scene+ points — that's hard to beat anywhere in Canada's rewards landscape. The lower $120 annual fee (vs. Cobalt's $191.88) also makes the math easier to justify.

### 3. CIBC Dividend Visa Infinite Card
**Best for: Loblaws shoppers who want real cashback, not points**

This is the card for people who shop at Loblaw-banner stores (No Frills, Real Canadian Superstore, Fortinos, Zehrs, Provigo) and want actual cash back without any points conversion math. The CIBC Dividend earns **4% cash back** on groceries and gas — and it's a Visa, which means it works everywhere, including grocery stores that don't take Amex.

**Annual fee:** $120 (commonly waived in year one)

**Earn rates:**
- 4% cash back on eligible groceries and gas (up to $20,000/year combined, then 1%)
- 2% on dining, transit/transportation, and recurring bill payments
- 1% on everything else

**Income requirements:** $60,000 personal or $100,000 household annual income. This is a Visa Infinite card — if you don't qualify on income, the base Dividend Visa earns 3% on groceries with a lower income threshold.

**What "real cashback" actually means here:** You get statement credits, not points. You choose when to redeem (in $10 increments via CIBC app or online banking). There's no points transfer, no expiry date managing, no reward program cancellation risk. It hits your balance. Done.

**The $20,000 annual cap on 4% categories:** Groceries and gas combined. $20,000/year is about $1,667/month across both categories. Most households won't hit this, but if you drive a lot and grocery shop heavily, you'll want to track it. At $1,668+/month combined, the card drops to 1% — at which point you're paying $120/year for a 1% card on your biggest spend categories. Time to switch primary cards for the rest of the year if you hit the cap.

**Why it beats Amex cards at Loblaws:** PC Optimum and Loblaws loyalty runs on Visa/Mastercard. The CIBC Dividend at 4% cash back outperforms the PC Mastercard's 3% on groceries in raw cashback terms, and the 4% applies across all grocery chains — not just PC/Loblaw stores.

### 4. PC® World Elite® Mastercard®
**Best for: Dedicated Loblaws shoppers who want no annual fee**

If your grocery budget flows almost entirely through Loblaw-banner stores and you don't want to pay an annual fee, the PC World Elite Mastercard is a legitimate workhorse. It earns **30 PC Optimum points per dollar** (effectively 3%) at participating PC/Loblaw stores — No Frills, Real Canadian Superstore, Fortinos, Zehrs, Maxi, Provigo, and more.

**Annual fee:** $0

**Earn rates:**
- 30 points per $1 (~3%) at participating PC/Loblaw grocery stores and drug stores
- 45 points per $1 (~4.5%) at PC Travel and Loblaws Gas Bar
- 10 points per $1 (1%) everywhere else

**PC Optimum points value:** 10,000 points = $10 in-store. That's a clean 1¢ per point when you redeem at checkout. No transfers, no minimums (spend 2,000 points / $2 if you want). Points can be redeemed at Loblaw-banner grocery stores, Shoppers Drug Mart, and Loblaw pharmacy locations.

**The stacking bonus:** PC Optimum works on top of this card. When Shoppers offers 20x points events or PC Optimum runs targeted grocery multipliers, your card's base earn stacks with the promotion. During a good Shoppers Optimum event, total earn rates of 8–12% on specific products aren't unusual.

**Income requirements:** $80,000 personal or $150,000 household for the World Elite tier. If you don't qualify, the base PC Mastercard earns 25 points per $1 (~2.5%) at PC stores — still reasonable with no fee.

**The limitation:** The 3% rate is highly concentrated at PC/Loblaw stores. Everywhere else, you're earning 1%. If your grocery spend is split across Sobeys, Metro, and Costco, this card underperforms. It's a specialist card, not a daily driver.

### 5. Rogers Red World Elite Mastercard®
**Best for: Rogers/Fido customers who want no-fee cashback everywhere**

This card is the simplest option on this list: **2% cash back on all eligible Canadian dollar purchases** for active Rogers, Fido, Comwave, or Shaw customers — no categories, no caps, no annual fee. Groceries, restaurants, hardware stores, online shopping — everything earns at the same 2% rate.

**Annual fee:** $0 (for Rogers customers)

**Earn rates:**
- 2% cash back on all eligible non-USD purchases (Rogers/Fido/Shaw/Comwave customers)
- 1.5% cash back on non-USD purchases (non-Rogers customers)
- 3% back on eligible USD purchases

**The Rogers multiplier on redemptions:** When you redeem cash back toward your Rogers, Fido, or Shaw bill (via the Rogers Bank app), the value is boosted by 1.5x. So your 2% effectively becomes 3% applied against your phone or internet bill. If you have a $90/month Rogers plan, that's meaningful.

**Why it matters for groceries specifically:** Costco only accepts Mastercard. The Rogers Red is an excellent Costco card — the 2% applies there with no restrictions. Same for Loblaws, Walmart, and any store that doesn't take Amex. As a complementary card to a Cobalt or Scotia Gold Amex, it fills all the Amex-rejected retailers at a solid 2% floor.

**Income requirements:** $80,000 personal or $150,000 household for World Elite.

## Annual Grocery Savings Calculator

Here's how the top 5 cards stack up for a typical Canadian household spending **$1,100/month on groceries ($13,200/year)** — we'll run two scenarios: a Sobeys-primary shopper and a Loblaws/mixed-chain shopper.

### Scenario A: Sobeys-primary shopper ($1,100/month)

| Card | Earn Rate | Annual Points/Cashback | Points Value | Annual Fee | **Net Annual Value** |
|------|-----------|------------------------|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Scotia Gold Amex** | 6x at Sobeys | 79,200 Scene+ | ~$792 | $120 | **$672** |
| Amex Cobalt | 5x (capped $2,500/mo) | 66,000 MR | ~$660 | $191.88 | **$468** |
| CIBC Dividend Visa Infinite | 4% (up to $20K/yr) | $528 CB | $528 | $120 | **$408** |
| Rogers Red World Elite | 2% (no cap) | $264 CB | $264 | $0 | **$264** |
| PC World Elite | 1% (non-PC stores) | $132 CB | $132 | $0 | **$132** |

*Scotia Gold Amex wins decisively for Sobeys-focused households at 6x, clearing ~$672/year net.*

---

### Scenario B: Mixed-chain or Loblaws-primary shopper ($1,100/month)

| Card | Earn Rate | Annual Points/Cashback | Points Value | Annual Fee | **Net Annual Value** |
|------|-----------|------------------------|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Amex Cobalt** | 5x (most chains except PC/Costco/Walmart) | 66,000 MR | ~$660 | $191.88 | **$468** |
| **CIBC Dividend Visa Infinite** | 4% (works at Loblaws) | $528 CB | $528 | $120 | **$408** |
| **PC World Elite** | 3% (PC stores only) | $396 points | ~$396 | $0 | **$396** |
| Rogers Red World Elite | 2% (everywhere, all chains) | $264 CB | $264 | $0 | **$264** |
| Scotia Gold Amex | 5x (no Loblaws/Costco) | — | Limited | $120 | **Varies** |

*For Loblaws-primary shoppers: PC World Elite and CIBC Dividend are the strongest no-brainer picks. PC at 3% free, CIBC at 4% for $120/year.*

### The Combo That Beats All Single Cards

For households that shop at multiple chains, a **two-card stack** eliminates the Amex acceptance problem:

**Amex Cobalt** (groceries at Sobeys, Metro, FreshCo, independents) + **PC World Elite Mastercard** (Loblaws/No Frills/Costco via Mastercard)

- Cobalt at 5x on ~$700/month at Amex-accepting grocers = 42,000 MR/year (~$420)
- PC World Elite at 3% on ~$400/month at PC stores = $144/year
- **Combined annual value: ~$564**
- **Fees: $191.88 (Cobalt only — PC card is free)**
- **Net: ~$372/year**

Vs. using just the PC World Elite on everything: $132/year net. The Cobalt + PC combo adds **$240/year net** for $191.88 in extra fees — the Cobalt pays for itself and then some if you're splitting grocery spend across chains.

## What to Consider Before Choosing

**1. Where do you actually shop?**
This is the single most important variable. Pull up 3 months of grocery transactions and see which stores you're actually using. Loyalty to one banner makes card selection obvious. If you spread across 3–4 chains, a two-card approach usually wins.

**2. Do you want cashback or points?**
Cashback (CIBC, Rogers) is simpler — it hits your statement. Points (Cobalt MR, Scene+, PC Optimum) can deliver higher value when optimized but require more management. PC Optimum is the most approachable points program because redemption is in-store at checkout with no minimums.

**3. Are you a Rogers/Shaw/Fido customer?**
If yes, the Rogers Red is a strong no-fee baseline. Stack it with a category-specific card like the Cobalt and you've covered every store in Canada at a decent rate.

**4. Can you justify the Cobalt's annual fee?**
At the new $191.88 fee, you need to earn more than that in rewards to come out ahead. At 5x/1¢ per point, you need $3,838 in grocery + dining spend at Amex-accepting stores per year before you're in the black. That's $320/month. Most Canadian households easily clear this, but lighter spenders on a tight budget might prefer a no-fee card.

**5. Do you have Loblaws/PC loyalty locked in?**
The PC ecosystem (PC Optimum multiplier events, Shoppers 20x Fridays) stacks with whatever base earn rate your card provides. Combining a PC Mastercard with active engagement in PC Optimum promotions can push effective earn rates to 6–8% on targeted items during promotional periods.
