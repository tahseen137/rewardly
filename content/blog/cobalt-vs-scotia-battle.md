# Amex Cobalt vs. Scotia Gold Amex: Which is the Best Grocery Card for Canadians in 2026?

*12 min read · Credit Card Comparisons*

Two of Canada's best grocery rewards cards are the American Express Cobalt and the Scotiabank Gold American Express. On the surface, they look nearly identical — both earn 5x points at grocery stores, both are Amex-network cards, both sit in the "premium everyday" category. But dig into the details and they're fundamentally different products optimized for completely different spending profiles.

This is the breakdown. No fluff, just the math.

| | Amex Cobalt | Scotia Gold Amex |
|---|---|---|
| **Annual fee** | $191.88 ($15.99/month) | $120 |

## The Core Difference: Points Currencies

Before we get into the math, let's talk about what you're actually earning, because this is where the two cards diverge completely.

**Amex Membership Rewards (MR) points** are flexible, transferable, and variable in value. At their base level — cashing out as statement credits — they're worth 1 cent each. But transferred to airline and hotel partners (Air Canada Aeroplan, Marriott Bonvoy, Hilton Honors, British Airways Avios), they can be worth 1.5 to 3 cents or more depending on how you redeem. The ceiling is high.

The catch: realizing that higher value requires knowing how to play the points game. If you're comfortable with transfer partners and willing to search for award space, MR points can stretch significantly. If you're going to cash them out for statement credits or gift cards, you're getting 1 cent per point — exactly the same as Scene+ points.

**Scene+ points** are simpler and consistent. One point is worth exactly 1 cent toward:
- Movies at Cineplex
- Travel bookings through Scotia's portal
- Statement credits
- Gift cards at Sobeys/IGA/FreshCo (and other partner merchants)

There's no way to get more than 1 cent per Scene+ point. No transfer partners, no aspirational redemptions. What you see is what you get. For many people, this is a feature, not a bug — predictable value beats complicated optimization.

## Grocery Math: Which Card Pays More?

### Scenario 1: $600/month grocery spend (typical family)

**Amex Cobalt:**
- $600 × 5 points = 3,000 MR points/month
- Annual points: 36,000 MR
- Value at 1¢/pt: $360
- Value at 1.5¢/pt (travel redemptions): $540
- Minus annual fee ($191.88): **net $168 — $348/year in value**

**Scotia Gold Amex:**
- If shopping at non-Sobeys stores: $600 × 5 = 3,000 Scene+/month
- If shopping at Sobeys/Safeway/IGA: $600 × 3 = 1,800 Scene+/month
- Annual points (non-Sobeys): 36,000 Scene+ = $360
- Annual points (Sobeys): 21,600 Scene+ = $216
- Minus annual fee ($120): **net $240/year (non-Sobeys) or $96/year (Sobeys)**

**Winner at $600/month groceries:**
- Cobalt wins if you redeem MR for travel (by a wide margin at 1.5¢+)
- Cobalt wins at 1¢ redemption too if shopping at non-Sobeys stores and you maximize travel
- Scotia Gold wins if your primary store is Sobeys/Safeway/IGA (where Scotia only earns 3x) AND you don't use travel redemptions

---

### Scenario 2: $1,200/month grocery + dining combined

Many Canadians spend heavily across both categories. Here the Cobalt really shines because its 5x rate applies equally to restaurants and cafes — not just groceries.

**Amex Cobalt:**
- $1,200 × 5 points = 6,000 MR points/month
- Well under the $2,500/month cap
- Annual: 72,000 MR = $720 at 1¢, up to $1,440+ at 2¢ (travel)
- Minus fee: **net $528 — $1,248/year**

**Scotia Gold Amex:**
- $600 groceries (non-Sobeys) × 5 = 3,000 Scene+
- $600 dining × 3 = 1,800 Scene+ (dining only earns 3x on Scotia)
- Monthly: 4,800 Scene+
- Annual: 57,600 = $576
- Minus fee: **net $456/year**

**Winner:** Cobalt wins decisively for restaurant + grocery spenders, especially anyone using MR points for travel.

---

### Scenario 3: $2,000/month grocery + dining (high spender)

At this level, the Cobalt's $2,500/month spending cap starts to matter. If your total food/dining spend consistently approaches or exceeds that cap, your effective rate drops.

**Amex Cobalt:**
- $2,000 × 5 = 10,000 MR points (still under cap) 
- Annual: 120,000 MR = $1,200 at 1¢
- Minus fee: **net $1,008/year**

**Scotia Gold Amex:**
- $1,000 groceries × 5 (non-Sobeys) = 5,000 Scene+
- $1,000 dining × 3 = 3,000 Scene+
- Monthly: 8,000 Scene+
- Annual: 96,000 = $960
- Minus fee: **net $840/year**

**Winner:** Cobalt still wins at 1¢ redemption; at 1.5¢ travel redemptions, it's not close.

---

## The Fee Gap: Is the Cobalt Worth the Extra $71.88/Year?

The Cobalt costs $191.88/year. The Scotia Gold costs $120/year. That's $71.88 more for the Cobalt.

To break even on the fee difference, the Cobalt needs to earn at least $71.88 more in annual rewards — or you need to value MR points above 1 cent.

At 1¢/point value (identical to Scene+):
- You need 7,188 more MR points from the Cobalt annually
- That's ~$1,438 more in grocery/dining spend at 5x earning the difference

At 1.5¢/point value (moderate travel redemption):
- The Cobalt's points are worth 50% more, so you'd have to spend significantly less for the Cobalt to pull ahead

**Break-even analysis:**

| Monthly grocery/dining | Cobalt surplus (at 1¢) | Cobalt surplus (at 1.5¢) |
|---|---|---|
| $400/month | -$22 (Cobalt behind) | +$216 (Cobalt ahead) |
| $600/month | +$48 | +$372 |
| $800/month | +$117 | +$527 |
| $1,200/month | +$256 | +$837 |

The Cobalt breaks even against the Scotia Gold at roughly $500/month in combined grocery and dining spend (assuming 1¢ MR redemption). Above that threshold, the Cobalt consistently wins.

## The Grocery Store Acceptance Problem

Here's the practical issue nobody mentions in comparison articles: both cards are American Express, and Amex acceptance is notoriously patchy in Canada.

**Stores that don't accept American Express (either card):**
- **Costco** — Mastercard only
- **Superstore / PC Express** — Mastercard only  
- **No Frills / Maxi** — Visa and Mastercard only
- **Walmart** — Mastercard preferred (some Walmart locations accept Amex, but inconsistent)
- **FreshCo** — some locations, not all

If you do a significant portion of your grocery shopping at Costco, Superstore, or No Frills, you're going to have a gap with either card. The workaround for the Cobalt is buying Sobeys or Metro gift cards at a participating Amex merchant (which still earns 5x), but that's friction.

For stores where Amex is accepted:
- Metro: both cards work, 5x on Cobalt, 5x on Scotia
- Sobeys: both cards work, 5x on Cobalt, **3x on Scotia** (Sobeys is a partner store)
- IGA: both work, 5x on Cobalt, **3x on Scotia**
- FreshCo (non-Sobeys locations): 5x on Cobalt, 5x or 3x on Scotia depending on operator
- Farm Boy: both work, 5x on both
- Whole Foods: both work, 5x on Cobalt, 5x on Scotia

**The Sobeys/IGA/Safeway Gap**

This is the least-publicized Scotia Gold disadvantage. Sobeys and its banner stores (IGA, Safeway, Thrifty Foods, FreshCo, Foodland) are listed as "accelerated partner" stores — which sounds good but actually means you only earn 3x Scene+ instead of the general 5x. If you primarily shop at Sobeys or IGA, the Scotia Gold earns 40% fewer points at your main grocery store than advertised.

The Cobalt earns 5x across all eligible grocery stores with no partner exceptions.

---

## Foreign Transaction Fees: Huge Scotia Advantage

The Scotia Gold Amex has **no foreign transaction fees**. This is genuinely rare for a card at this price point.

The Cobalt charges **2.5% on foreign currency transactions** — the standard Canadian rate.

If you spend any significant amount in USD or other currencies (online shopping, travel, subscriptions), this matters:
- $2,000/year in USD spending → the Cobalt costs you $50 more in forex fees
- $5,000/year in USD spending → $125 more
- $10,000/year (regular international traveler) → $250 more

For international travelers, the Scotia Gold's forex fee savings can offset most of the fee difference on their own.

---

## Welcome Bonuses and Promotions

**Amex Cobalt current offer:**
Typically 15,000 MR points after $3,000 spent in the first 3 months. Some promotional offers include monthly bonus points in the first year (e.g., 2,500 bonus points per month for spending $500/month). Annual fee is not waived.

**Scotia Gold Amex current offer:**
20,000 Scene+ points after $1,000 spent in the first 3 months (worth $200 as a welcome offer). Annual fee is sometimes waived in the first year for new cardholders, making the effective first-year cost $0.

If you can get the Scotia Gold's first-year fee waiver, the first-year ROI is significantly higher — you're getting $200 in welcome bonus points plus a full year of earning with no fee. The Cobalt doesn't offer first-year fee waivers.

## Scene+ vs. MR Points: Real-World Redemption Comparison

### For Canadians who don't travel-hack:

**Scene+ wins.** One point = one cent, always. No transfer ratios to memorize, no availability calendars to check, no sweet spots to learn. You can use points directly at Cineplex, redeem against travel bookings at 1¢/point, or get statement credits. Simple, predictable, portable.

MR points at 1¢ per point (statement credits, Amex travel, gift cards) are equally valuable — but the system is more complex and the temptation is to try to optimize, which requires time and knowledge.

### For Canadians who travel-hack Aeroplan:

**MR wins, and it's not close.** The Cobalt earns MR points that transfer 1:1 to Aeroplan. Aeroplan points regularly return 2-3+ cents per point on premium cabin awards. A 10,000 MR point transfer to Aeroplan could cover a $200-300 business class upgrade or a $300+ transatlantic flight segment. The same 10,000 Scene+ points are worth exactly $100.

Cobalt → Aeroplan is one of the strongest earning-to-redemption pipelines in Canadian personal finance.

### For movie fans / Cineplex-goers:

**Scene+ wins** for anyone who regularly goes to Cineplex. A free movie ticket typically requires 1,000-1,250 Scene+ points ($10-12.50 equivalent) and is very straightforward to redeem. MR points don't have an equivalent direct entertainment redemption.

### For grocery cashback at Sobeys:

**Scene+** points can be redeemed directly at checkout at Sobeys, IGA, and other partner stores — essentially cash back at the grocery store. This makes them particularly useful for the exact spend category you're earning them on. MR points don't have a grocery redemption option.

## Who Should Get the Amex Cobalt?

- You spend **$500+/month** on grocery and dining combined
- You're interested in travel rewards and willing to learn MR transfer partners
- Your main grocery store(s) accept Amex (Metro, Farm Boy, specialty stores, independents)
- You don't do significant foreign currency spending
- You want the highest earn rate on restaurant spending (5x vs. Scotia's 3x)

## Who Should Get the Scotia Gold Amex?

- You travel internationally and want to avoid forex fees
- Your primary grocery store is Sobeys, IGA, or Safeway (where Cobalt still earns 5x, but it's worth comparing total card value)
- You prefer simplicity over optimization — 1 point = 1 cent, no complexity
- You spend moderately on dining ($300-500/month) where the earn rate gap matters less
- You want the lower annual fee with similar earn rates on groceries
- You'd take advantage of a first-year fee waiver if available

---

## Can You Have Both?

Yes, and many Canadians do. The usual setup:

- **Cobalt** for groceries (at Metro, Farm Boy, independents) and all restaurants
- **Scotia Gold** as the international travel card (no forex fees)
- A **Visa or Mastercard** as backup for Costco, Superstore, No Frills

The Cobalt earns more in Canada. The Scotia Gold earns at 1x internationally but saves you 2.5% on foreign purchases. They're complementary rather than competitive for frequent travelers.

---

## The Bottom Line

If you had to pick one card and your spending is primarily in Canada at metro-style grocery stores plus restaurants:

**Pick the Cobalt if:**
- You spend $500+/month in food/dining and want to maximize points
- You'll redeem for travel (Aeroplan especially)
- You're comfortable with the $191.88 annual fee

**Pick the Scotia Gold if:**
- You travel internationally and hate foreign transaction fees
- You primarily shop at Sobeys/Safeway/IGA (where Cobalt wins on earn rate but Scotia saves on forex)
- You want a simpler, lower-fee card with solid grocery rewards
- You can get the first-year fee waiver

At $600/month in grocery + dining, the Cobalt puts more money back in your pocket on a pure 1¢/point basis. At 1.5¢+ per point (Aeroplan, travel), the gap widens substantially. The Scotia Gold's advantage is the lower fee, forex savings, and simplicity.

Neither card is wrong. They just optimize for different things.

## Quick Math: Your Annual Value by Scenario

| Monthly grocery + dining | Cobalt net value (1¢/pt) | Cobalt net value (1.5¢/pt) | Scotia Gold net value |
|---|---|---|---|
| $400 | $48 | $192 | $120 |
| $600 | $168 | $390 | $240 |
| $800 | $288 | $588 | $360 |
| $1,000 | $408 | $786 | $480 |
| $1,500 | $708 | $1,281 | $780 |

*Scotia Gold values assume 5x grocery earn (non-Sobeys stores) + 3x dining. Cobalt assumes 5x on all grocery and dining up to $2,500/month cap.*
