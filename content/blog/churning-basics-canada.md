# Credit Card Churning for Canadians: A Beginner's Guide (2026 Edition)

If you’ve ever scrolled through social media and seen someone sipping champagne in a lie-flat business class seat on a flight to Tokyo, you probably assumed they were wealthy. Or maybe they have a job that involves constant corporate travel. 

But for a growing community of Canadians, those $10,000 flights aren't paid for with cash or corporate expense accounts. They’re paid for with points. And those points aren't earned by spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a credit card. They are earned through a strategy called **credit card churning**.

In 2026, the Canadian credit card landscape is more competitive than ever. Banks are fighting for your business with massive welcome bonuses that can be worth $500, $1,000, or even $2,000 in travel value. Churning is the art of systematically capturing these bonuses to fund a lifestyle that would otherwise be out of reach.

This guide is for the beginner. We’ll break down exactly what churning is, how it affects your credit score (spoiler: it’s not as bad as you think), and how you can use tools like **Rewardly** to manage the process without losing your mind.

## What Exactly Is Credit Card Churning?

At its simplest, credit card churning is the practice of signing up for a credit card primarily to earn its welcome bonus, using the card for your regular spending to meet the "minimum spend requirement," and then either cancelling or downgrading the card before the second year's annual fee hits. You then repeat this process with a new card.

### The "Points Math" Problem

To understand why churning is so effective, you have to look at the math of "organic" spending. 

Most premium credit cards in Canada earn between 1 and 5 points per dollar spent. If you want to book a business class flight from Toronto to London using Aeroplan points, it might cost you 85,000 points. 

If you earn 1 point per dollar, you’d need to spend **$85,000** to get that flight. For the average Canadian, that could take three or four years of diligent saving.

Now look at a typical welcome bonus. A card like the **TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite** often offers a welcome bonus of 50,000 to 75,000 points if you spend $5,000 in the first three months. 

By spending just $5,000—money you were already going to spend on groceries, gas, and rent—you’ve earned nearly enough points for that $5,000 business class seat. 

**Churning turns years of waiting into months of execution.**

## The Credit Score Myth: Will This Ruin My Credit?

The #1 question every beginner asks is: *"Won't opening and closing all these cards destroy my credit score?"*

The short answer is: **No, provided you are disciplined.**

Your credit score (calculated by Equifax or TransUnion in Canada) is made up of several factors. Understanding how churning affects each one is key to maintaining a high score while racking up points.

### 1. Payment History (35%)
This is the most important factor. As long as you pay your bills on time and in full every single month, your score will remain healthy. Churning requires you to be hyper-organized. One missed payment will do more damage to your score than ten new credit card applications.

### 2. Credit Utilization (30%)
This is the ratio of your total debt to your total available credit. When you churn, you are actually *increasing* your total available credit. If you have $50,000 in available credit across five cards but only spend $2,000 a month, your utilization is a very healthy 4%. Opening more cards actually *lowers* your utilization, which can move your score **up**.

### 3. Credit History Length (15%)
This is where churning can have a slight negative impact. When you open a new account, the "average age" of your accounts decreases. Lenders like to see long-term relationships. 
**The Fix:** Never cancel your oldest credit card. Keep one or two "anchor" cards that you've had for years. For your churned cards, try to "downgrade" them to a no-fee version instead of cancelling them outright whenever possible. This preserves the account's age on your report.

### 4. Credit Mix and New Inquiries (10% each)
Every time you apply for a card, the bank does a "hard pull" on your credit. This usually drops your score by 3–5 points temporarily. However, after 3–6 months of on-time payments, the score typically bounces back. 

**Summary:** Most active churners maintain credit scores in the 750–820 range. The "hit" from a new application is tiny compared to the long-term benefit of a perfect payment history.

## The Golden Rules of Churning

Before you apply for your first card, you must commit to these three rules. If you can't follow them, churning will cost you more than it earns you.

### Rule #1: Never Pay Interest
The interest rates on rewards cards are usually 20.99% or higher. If you carry a balance even for one month, the interest charges will completely wipe out the value of the points you earned. Churning only works if you pay your statement in full every month.

### Rule #2: Only Spend What You Can Afford
Do not buy things you don't need just to hit a minimum spend requirement. If a card requires $5,000 in spend over three months but you only spend $1,000 a month, that card isn't for you right now. Wait for a lower spend requirement or wait until you have a large upcoming purchase (like a new laptop or car repairs).

### Rule #3: Stay Organized
Missing a deadline to hit a spend requirement means you lose the bonus. Forgetting to cancel a card before the annual fee hits means you lose $150+. You need a system. (This is where **Rewardly** comes in—more on that later).

## Step-by-Step: Your First Churn

Ready to start? Here is the blueprint for your first successful churn.

### Step 1: Check Your Current Status
Check your credit score using a free service like Borrowell (Equifax) or Credit Karma (TransUnion). If your score is below 700, focus on cleaning up your existing debt before you start churning.

### Step 2: Pick Your Target
In Canada, the "Big Three" ecosystems are:
1.  **Aeroplan (Air Canada):** Best for international travel.
2.  **American Express Membership Rewards:** The most flexible points.
3.  **WestJet Rewards / RBC Avion:** Great for domestic and US travel.

For a beginner, we recommend starting with an **Aeroplan** card or the **Amex Cobalt**.

### Step 3: The Application
Apply online. Most people get an instant "Approved" or "Pending" message. If you get "Pending," don't panic. It often just means a human needs to verify your identity or income. 

### Step 4: The Minimum Spend Period
Once the card arrives, move all your daily spending to it. Groceries, gas, insurance, streaming services—everything. 
**Pro-tip:** If you're struggling to hit the spend, look into "pre-paying" bills. Many utility companies allow you to carry a credit balance. You can also buy gift cards for stores you know you'll use later (like Loblaws or Amazon).

### Step 5: Collect and Redeem
Once you hit the spend, the bonus usually posts to your account within 1–2 billing cycles. This is the fun part. Start looking at flight redemptions!

### Step 6: The "Exit Strategy"
Mark your calendar for 11 months from the date you opened the card. At this point, you have three options:
1.  **Keep the card:** If the perks (like free lounge access or a high earn rate) justify the annual fee.
2.  **Cancel the card:** If you've moved the points to a safe place (like an Aeroplan account) and don't need the card anymore.
3.  **Downgrade (Product Switch):** Call the bank and ask to move the account to a no-fee version. This keeps your credit history alive and avoids the fee.

## Top 3 Cards for Canadian Churners in Feb 2026

The "best" card changes every month as banks update their offers. However, these three are consistently at the top of the list for value.

### 1. American Express Cobalt Card
*   **The Vibe:** The best "daily driver" in Canada.
*   **The Bonus:** Up to 30,000 MR points (distributed monthly).
*   **The Superpower:** 5x points on Food and Drinks (Groceries, Restaurants, Coffee, Food Delivery).
*   **Why it's for beginners:** It teaches you the value of "multipliers." If you spend $500/month on food, you're earning 30,000 points a year just from your normal life.

### 2. TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite
*   **The Vibe:** The travel hacking on-ramp.
*   **The Bonus:** Frequently offers 50,000+ Aeroplan points and a first-year fee rebate.
*   **The Superpower:** First checked bag free for you and up to 8 companions on Air Canada flights. This perk alone can save a family of four $240 on a single round trip.

### 3. Scotiabank Gold American Express
*   **The Vibe:** The "No-FX" Workhorse.
*   **The Bonus:** Usually 40,000 Scene+ points (worth $400 in travel or groceries).
*   **The Superpower:** No Foreign Transaction fees. Most Canadian cards charge 2.5% on every purchase made in USD or other currencies. This card saves you that 2.5% while still earning rewards.

## Advanced Strategies: Thinking Like a Pro

Once you've done your first 2–3 cards, you'll start to notice patterns. Here is how the pros maximize their returns.

### The "Amex Once Per Lifetime" Rule
In Canada, American Express generally only allows you to earn the welcome bonus on a specific card once per lifetime. If you had the Platinum card in 2022, you won't get the bonus again in 2026. 
**Strategy:** Wait for "all-time high" offers before applying. Don't waste your "one shot" on a mediocre 20,000-point bonus if the card sometimes offers 60,000.

### Business Cards (For Non-Business Owners)
Many of the best bonuses are on "Small Business" cards. You do not need a multi-million dollar corporation to apply. If you sell things on Facebook Marketplace, tutor on weekends, or drive for Uber, you are a sole proprietor. You can apply using your own name as the business name.

### Household Pooling
Churning is a team sport. If you have a partner, you can "refer" each other to cards. 
**Example:** You have an Amex Cobalt. You refer your partner. You get a 5,000-point referral bonus, and your partner gets the 30,000-point welcome bonus. Between the two of you, you've just generated 35,000 points from one application.

## Common Pitfalls (And How to Avoid Them)

### 1. The "Second Year Surprise"
Banks count on you forgetting when your annual fee is due. If you opened a card on Feb 15, 2025, you will be charged the fee on Feb 1, 2026. 
**Avoid it:** Set a calendar alert for 11 months after opening.

### 2. Missing the "Minimum Spend" by a Cent
If the requirement is $5,000 and you spend $4,999.99, you get **zero** bonus points. Banks are ruthless about this. 
**Avoid it:** Always aim to spend $100–$200 *over* the requirement to account for any returns or disputed charges.

### 3. Applying Too Fast
If you apply for five cards in one day, your credit score will tank and banks will flag you for "credit seeking" behavior.
**Avoid it:** Space your applications out by at least 3 months as a beginner. Pro churners might go every 2 months, but they have established histories.
