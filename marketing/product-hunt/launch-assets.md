## 4. Maker Story / First Comment
```markdown
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Aragorn, founder of Rewardly. I built this after getting frustrated with credit card rewards in Canada.

## The Problem

I had 4 credit cards in my wallet. Every time I was about to pay, I'd pull out my phone and check which card gave me the best rewards for that category. Groceries? Cobalt. Gas? Triangle. Dining? Maybe Avion? I spent more time optimizing than I did shopping.

The apps that exist (MaxRewards, SaveSage) are all US-focused. They don't understand Canadian cards, Canadian banks, or the fact that "groceries" at Costco is treated differently than "groceries" at Loblaws.

## The Solution

Rewardly is a credit card optimizer built FOR Canada, BY Canadians:

- **410+ cards** (every major Canadian issuer: RBC, TD, Scotiabank, BMO, CIBC, Amex, Tangerine, etc.)
- **Category-based recommendations** — type "gas station, $60" and it shows you the optimal card
- **Sage AI** — conversational assistant that answers stuff like "What's the best no-annual-fee cashback card?"
- **Real calculations** — takes annual fees into account, not just base rates

## Why Now?

Most Canadians are leaving $300-500/year on the table by using sub-optimal cards. The tools to fix this exist in the US (MaxRewards has 800K users), but nothing built specifically for Canada. We're fixing that.

## What's Next?

- Transaction import (link your bank account, get automatic card recommendations)
- Achievements/gamification (earn badges for optimal usage)
- Referral tracking (get notified when sign-up bonuses are available)

## Ask Me Anything

I've been building this for 3 weeks. We have 1,187 automated tests, a full admin dashboard, and it's live at **rewardly.ca** right now.

Try it out. Tell me what breaks. Tell me which cards are missing. This is for all of us tired of leaving free money on the table.
